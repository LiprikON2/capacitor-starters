# Next.js + Tailwind CSS + Supertokens + Capacitor Mobile Starter

By: [@RobSchilderr](https://github.com/RobSchilderr).

This monorepo provides a starter project for building a web application with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Supertokens for authentication and session management, as well as a mobile application using Capacitor. This allows you to use the same React UI for iOS, Android and the Web. The project is structured using Turborepo, with one repository for the web application and another for the mobile app. The code for both is shared using a `ui` package and other packages.
